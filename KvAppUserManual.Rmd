## Getting Started

Although K~v~App is developed in MATLAB, it does not require MATLAB installed on the machine. Instead, running `MyAppInstaller_web` will install the packaged application and MATLAB Runtime from the Internet, which enables the application to run without MATLAB. A machine needs to be connected to the Internet to complete the installation.
