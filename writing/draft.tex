\begin{abstract}
Electrical signaling plays vital roles in the heart that initiates and controls the synchronous contraction of cardiac muscles. Voltage-gated ion channels (VGICs) are the functional unit of electrical activities in cardiomyocytes. Among major cardiac VGICs, K\textsuperscript{+} channels (K\textsubscript{v}) have a distinctive feature that they have multiple isoforms. Although each K\textsubscript{v} isoform produces a unique but slightly overlapping current, having different functionality, only the sum of these individual K\textsuperscript{+} currents (I\textsubscript{Ksum}) can be recorded through in-vitro experiments. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop a data assimilation method that combines mathematical models with experimental data, I\textsubscript{Ksum} recordings, to estimate individual K\textsuperscript{+} currents. Exponential fitting is a traditional method based on the assumption that prominent K\textsuperscript{+} currents have the shape of an exponential decay function. It has been proven that exponential fitting describes I\textsubscript{Ksum} well with estimated K\textsuperscript{+} currents. However, the mathematical model of this classical method only characterizes the shape of the currents, not the kinetics of corresponding K\textsubscript{v} isoforms. In addition, exponential fitting handles I\textsubscript{Ksum} recordings from the same cell with different conditions independently, so it lacks the cellular-level analysis. This paper presents a data assimilation method based on the cellular-level simulation of the underlying gating kinetics of K\textsubscript{v} isoforms. Computer models are designed with parameters that allow us to control the behavior of the ion channel models. A fractional factorial design is utilized to identify the parameters having significant effects on the current shape. Then, various nonlinear optimization methods were applied and compared to calibrate the selected parameters to minimize the discrepancies between the simulated currents and I\textsubscript{Ksum} recordings from the same cell. Further, we develop a graphical user interface (GUI) to provide a user-friendly environment to test the proposed method for practitioners unfamiliar with coding. We conduct a case study with our in-vitro experimental data investigating the effect of reduced glycosylation on K\textsubscript{v}. Experimental results show that the proposed method has strong potential to be a novel analysis tool to decompose I\textsubscript{Ksum} recordings to estimate not only the current characteristics but also kinetics of K\textsubscript{v} isoforms that gives a better understanding of disease-related perturbations.

\section{Introduction}
Cardiac muscle cells have a conduction system that controls the propagation of electrical excitation, which triggers and synchronizes the mechanical contraction of the network of a large number of cardiomyocytes \cite{veeraraghavan2014mechanisms}. In turn, this electrical signaling system is responsible for the heart to pump blood throughout the body properly. Cardiac voltage-gated ion channels (VGICs) are membrane proteins in a cardiomyocyte that control specific ions to flow through the membrane \cite{bezanilla2005vgic}. They are fundamental functional units of electrical activities in cardiomyocytes as the electrical excitation results from the orchestrated dynamics of different types of ionic currents controlled by the gating kinetics of VGICs as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:variety_ionc} \cite{grant2009cardiac}. This electrical simulation is called the action potentials (AP), which is the net change of membrane potential, and there are three major cardiac VIGCs contributing to the shape and length of the AP: Na\textsuperscript{+}  (Na\textsubscript{v}), Ca\textsuperscript{2+}  (Ca\textsubscript{v}), and K\textsuperscript{+}  (K\textsubscript{v}) channels. Na\textsubscript{v} are responsible for AP initiation (depolarization phase), Ca\textsubscript{v} are responsible for the prolonged depolarization phase (``plateau'') particularly in larger species like human, while various isoforms of K\textsubscript{v}s are collectively responsible for AP deactivation (repolarization phase). 
\begin{figure}[!ht]

    \label{fig:variety_ionc}
\end{figure}

In contrast to Na\textsubscript{v} and Ca\textsubscript{v}, K\textsubscript{v} have a distinctive feature that they have multiple isoforms. Each isoform produces different but slightly overlapping component of the total K\textsuperscript{+} current (I\textsubscript{Ksum}) and contributes to different portions of the AP repolarization. To be specific, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:variety_ionc}, there are various K\textsubscript{v} isoforms and currents conducted through them: the transient outward K\textsuperscript{+} current I\textsubscript{Kto} (K\textsubscript{v}4.2/K\textsubscript{v}4.3) several components of delayed rectifier K\textsuperscript{+} currents including I\textsubscript{Ks} (K\textsubscript{v}7.1 and minK), I\textsubscript{Kr} (mERG), I\textsubscript{Kslow1} (K\textsubscript{v}1.5), and I\textsubscript{Kslow2} (K\textsubscript{v}2.1), non-inactivating steady-state K\textsuperscript{+} current I\textsubscript{Kss} (K\textsubscript{2P}), and time independent K\textsuperscript{+} current I\textsubscript{K1} (Kir2 family) \cite{brouillette2004functional, liu2011dissection}. Note that although there are two types of transient outward currents, I\textsubscript{Ktof} and I\textsubscript{Ktos}, 
they are referred to as one, I\textsubscript{Kto}, because I\textsubscript{Ktos} is reported to appear only in the ventricular septum myocytes \cite{xu1999four}. There are several K\textsubscript{v} isoforms whose exact roles in shaping the cardiac AP are still subject of intensive research. Although it is highly desirable to study each unique K\textsuperscript{+} current rigorously, only I\textsubscript{Ksum} can be recorded through in-vitro experiments.

Hence, there is an urgent need to develop a data analysis tool to estimate individual K\textsuperscript{+} currents from I\textsubscript{Ksum}. Data assimilation is a scientific method that combines mathematical models and experimental data to calibrate the models; thereby, the in-silico models are compatible with the in-vitro observations. To be specific, for our case, a data assimilation method is required that couples mathematical models of K\textsuperscript{+} models with experimental data of I\textsubscript{Ksum} using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings to estimate various K\textsuperscript{+} currents. Exponential fitting is a traditional method based on the assumption that prominent K\textsuperscript{+} currents from patch-clamp recordings such as I\textsubscript{Kto}, I\textsubscript{Kslow1}, and I\textsubscript{Kslow2} have the shape of an exponential decay function $A_{i}e^{-t/\tau_{i}}$ as in Equation~\ref{eq:sumexp_model}, where $t$ is time variable, and $A_{i}$ and $\tau_{i}$ are the shape parameters. I\textsubscript{kss} is simplified as constant $A\textsubscript{Kss}$. It has been proven that exponential fitting accurately describes I\textsubscript{Ksum} with estimated K\textsuperscript{+} currents and has served as a standard method to analyze the sum of K\textsuperscript{+} currents \cite{brunet2004heterogeneous, liu2011dissection}. However, the mathematical model of this classical method only characterizes the shape of the currents, not the kinetics of corresponding K\textsubscript{v} isoforms. In addition, exponential fitting handles I\textsubscript{Ksum} recordings from the same cell with different conditions independently, so it lacks systematic analyses at the cellular level. 
\begin{equation}
    \text{I}\textsubscript{Ksum} = \sum_{i} A_{i} e^{-t/\tau_{i}} + A\textsubscript{Kss}, \; i \in I \subseteq \{\text{Kto, } \text{Kslow1, } \text{Kslow2}\} \label{eq:sumexp_model}
\end{equation}

On the other hand, computer models of cardiac electrophysiology can simulate complex dynamics of electrical activities at the cellular level that enable the quantitative understanding of biophysical functions such as gating kinetics of VGICs in the behavior of cardiomyocytes \cite{winslow2011integrative}. This paper proposes a data assimilation method based on the computer models of K\textsubscript{v} isoforms that facilitates kinetics modeling at the cellular level. Hodgkin-Huxley-type computer models of potassium isoforms are developed with parameters that act like ``knobs'', allowing to control the behavior of the models. The more parameters the models have, the more flexible they are, but surplus parameters increase the risk of overfitting, make interpretation of calibration results harder, and have a chance to acerbate calibration accuracy. We utilize a fractional factorial design to identify parameters that significantly affect the current shape, which is a standard sensitivity analysis tool \cite{du2015statistical, du2017silico}. A calibration process consists of an objective function and an optimization method to minimize that objective. We derive the objective function measuring discrepancies between experimental I\textsubscript{Ksum} recordings and simulated ones for each cell. VGIC kinetics is a nonlinear process \cite{rudy2006computational}, so nonlinear optimization methods are utilized. A graphical user interface (GUI) is provided in which researchers can easily apply the proposed method to their data and visualize the modeling results.
