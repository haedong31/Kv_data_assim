\section{Introduction} \label{s:intro}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Motivation} Voltage-gated ion channels (VGICs) are the functional unit of the electrical conduction system of the heart that controls the synchronous contraction of numerous cardiomyocytes. Among major cardiac VGICs, K\textsuperscript{+} channels (K\textsubscript{v}) have a distinctive feature: they have various isoforms that contribute to K\textsuperscript{+} current, while the dominant isoform is responsible for Na\textsuperscript{+} and Ca\textsuperscript{2+} currents. Although each K\textsubscript{+} generated through K\textsubscript{v} isoform has a different role in the repolarization phase, only the sum of these individual K\textsuperscript{+} currents (I\textsubscript{Ksum}) can be recorded through in-vitro experiments. Data analysis tools are used to estimate information about K\textsubscript{v} isoforms from experimental I\textsubscript{Ksum} recordings.
    \item \textbf{Gaps \& Needs} A traditional approach is based on the data-driven curve fitting method that assumes the functional forms for the shape of individual K\textsuperscript{+} currents. This method directly fits individual K\textsuperscript{+} currents to experimental I\textsubscript{Ksum} recordings by searching the shape parameters of the current functions that have the best fit. It has been proven that the curve fitting approach describes I\textsubscript{Ksum} well with estimated K\textsuperscript{+} currents. However, the mathematical form of this classical method only characterizes the shape of the currents, not the kinetics of corresponding K\textsubscript{v} isoforms. In addition, the curve fitting method handles experimental I\textsubscript{Ksum} recordings from the same cell independently, so it lacks the cellular-level analysis.
    \item \textbf{Objective} As opposed to the traditional data-driven curve fitting method, we propose a novel framework of biophysics-driven data assimilation method for kinetics modeling of K\textsubscript{v} isoforms based on computer models of K\textsuperscript{+} currents that can simulate underlying gating kinetics of the currents.
    \item \textbf{Approach} 
    \item \textbf{Experiment \& Performance} The proposed framework outperforms the curve fitting method for minimizing discrepancies between experimental and estimated total K\textsuperscript{+} currents. We also provide the kinetics modeling results that are not possible in the traditional method.
    \item \textbf{Significance} Experimental results show that the proposed method has strong potential to be a novel analysis tool to decompose I\textsubscript{Ksum} recordings to estimate not only the current characteristics but also kinetics of K\textsubscript{v} isoforms.
